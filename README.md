# Algorithmic Problem Solving Practice

In this assignment, you will be working in pairs to practice your algorithmic problem-solving skills using various JavaScript problems. The goal is to become proficient in the problem-solving process and to be able to apply algorithmic frameworks effectively.

## Assignment Details

- **Due Date:** Monday, 10 AM (no extensions will be granted)
- **Pair Programming:** You will work in pairs for this assignment.
- **Repositories:** Both students should create separate repositories for this assignment and submit them.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Your solutions must include pseudocode (commented out in your code).
  - You must use either the cyclic sort or fast/slow pointer algorithm to solve the problems.
  - You must solve at least 3 problems from Set A and 3 problems from Set B.
  - Each solution must have testing. Include at least one or two test cases to verify each of your solutions.

# LeetCode Problem Set

This repository contains a set of LeetCode problems divided into two sets: Set A and Set B. Each set consists of six problems with their respective descriptions and links to the LeetCode platform for further details and solutions.

## Set A

1. **Find the Missing Number**

   - Problem Description: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the missing number.

2. **Find All Duplicates in an Array**

   - Problem Description: Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in the array.

3. **Set Mismatch**

   - Problem Description: You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in the repetition of one number and the loss of another number. You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

6. **Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array**
   - Problem Description: Given an array of integers nums containing n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n]. Return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

## Set B

1. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

   - Problem Description: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

5. **Container With Most Water**

   - Problem Description: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn, and the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container that contains the most water.
